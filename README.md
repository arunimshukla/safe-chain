# Usage

![Aikido Safe Chain demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/main/docs/safe-package-manager-demo.gif)

## Installation

Installing the Aikido Safe Chain is easy with the installation script.

### Unix/Linux/macOS

```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.sh -o /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh \
  && echo "7a7b6e54c2e0adbcb53bc1bf7d258cc974f8f31e77ed048b88e4d2e4ac758839  /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh" | sha256sum -c - \
  && sh /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh \
  && rm /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "install-safe-chain.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.ps1" -OutFile $installer -UseBasicParsing
$expectedHash = "6F46B5CFA42DDF9545616E169A567E764CE179E6321E6555D2C3A81768E2635D"
if ((Get-FileHash $installer -Algorithm SHA256).Hash -ne $expectedHash) {
    Remove-Item $installer -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    throw "Checksum verification failed for install-safe-chain.ps1"
}
& $installer
Remove-Item $installer
```

The install commands above always reference a specific release. To install a different version, replace the version with your desired version number. All available versions are on the [releases page](https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases).

### Download integrity

The install scripts are served from a versioned release URL (`releases/download/1.5.16/...`). GitHub releases are immutable — once an artifact is published at a versioned URL it cannot be modified or replaced, so the file you download is guaranteed to be exactly what was released.

### Verify the installation

1. **❗Restart your terminal** to start using the Aikido Safe Chain.
   - This step is crucial as it ensures that the shell aliases for npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, pnpx, rush, rushx, bun, bunx, pip, pip3, poetry, uv, uvx, pipx and pdm are loaded correctly. If you do not restart your terminal, the aliases will not be available.

2. **Verify the installation** by running the verification command:

   ```shell
   npm safe-chain-verify
   pnpm safe-chain-verify
   pip safe-chain-verify
   uv safe-chain-verify

   # Any other supported package manager: {packagemanager} safe-chain-verify
   ```

   - The output should display "OK: Safe-chain works!" confirming that Aikido Safe Chain is properly installed and running.

3. **(Optional) Test malware blocking** by attempting to install a test package:

   For JavaScript/Node.js:

   ```shell
   npm install safe-chain-test
   ```

   For Python:

   ```shell
   pip3 install safe-chain-pi-test
   ```

   - The output should show that Aikido Safe Chain is blocking the installation of these test packages as they are flagged as malware.

When running `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `pnpx`, `rush`, `rushx`, `bun`, `bunx`, `pip`, `pip3`, `uv`, `uvx`, `poetry`, `pipx` and `pdm` commands, the Aikido Safe Chain will automatically check for malware in the packages you are trying to install. It also intercepts Python module invocations for pip when available (e.g., `python -m pip install ...`, `python3 -m pip download ...`). If any malware is detected, it will prompt you to exit the command.

You can check the installed version by running:

```shell
safe-chain --version
```

## How it works

### Malware Blocking

The Aikido Safe Chain works by running a lightweight proxy server that intercepts package downloads from the npm registry and PyPI. When you run npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, pnpx, rush, rushx, bun, bunx, pip, pip3, uv, uvx, poetry, pipx or pdm commands, all package downloads are routed through this local proxy, which verifies packages in real-time against **[Aikido Intel - Open Sources Threat Intelligence](https://intel.aikido.dev/?tab=malware)**. If malware is detected in any package (including deep dependencies), the proxy blocks the download before the malicious code reaches your machine.

### Minimum package age

Safe Chain applies minimum package age checks to supported ecosystems.

Current enforcement differs by ecosystem:

- npm-based package managers:
  - during normal package resolution, Safe Chain suppresses versions that are newer than the configured minimum age from the package metadata returned by the registry
  - for direct package download requests that bypass that metadata flow, Safe Chain can block the request itself using a cached list of newly released packages
- Python package managers:
  - during package resolution, Safe Chain suppresses too-young files and releases from PyPI metadata responses
  - for direct package download requests that bypass that metadata flow, Safe Chain can block the request itself using a cached list of newly released packages

By default, the minimum package age is 48 hours. This provides an additional security layer during the critical period when newly published packages are most vulnerable to containing undetected threats. You can configure this threshold or bypass this protection entirely - see the [Minimum Package Age Configuration](#minimum-package-age) section below.

### Shell Integration

The Aikido Safe Chain integrates with your shell to provide a seamless experience when using npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, pnpx, rush, rushx, bun, bunx, and Python package managers (pip, uv, uvx, poetry, pipx, pdm). It sets up aliases for these commands so that they are wrapped by the Aikido Safe Chain commands, which manage the proxy server before executing the original commands. We currently support:

- ✅ **Bash**
- ✅ **Zsh**
- ✅ **Fish**
- ✅ **PowerShell**
- ✅ **PowerShell Core**

More information about the shell integration can be found in the [shell integration documentation](https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/blob/main/docs/shell-integration.md).

### Usage with AI coding agents

AI coding agents such as Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor commonly run package managers in non-interactive subprocesses. These subprocesses do not always source `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or other shell startup files, so the functions created by `safe-chain setup` may not be available even when Safe Chain works in your interactive terminal.

Create executable package-manager shims for agent and subprocess use:

```shell
safe-chain setup-ci
export PATH="$HOME/.safe-chain/shims:$HOME/.safe-chain/bin:$PATH"
```

Start the agent from a shell with that `PATH`, or configure the agent environment to prepend those directories. Then verify that the shim is selected and Safe Chain is active:

```shell
command -v npm
# Expected: ~/.safe-chain/shims/npm

npm safe-chain-verify
# Expected: OK: Safe-chain works!
```

Safe Chain starts a local proxy on `127.0.0.1` using an ephemeral port when a package-manager command needs registry access. If the agent runs in a sandbox, allow the process to bind and connect to loopback (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`). Loopback access is required for the package manager to reach Safe Chain's proxy; disabling the sandbox is not required. The proxy binds only to loopback and is not exposed to the local network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agents must invoke package managers by name, such as `npm`, `uv`, or `pip`. Absolute paths such as `/usr/bin/npm` bypass both shell functions and `PATH` shims.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the Aikido Safe Chain, use our one-line uninstaller:

### Unix/Linux/macOS

```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/uninstall-safe-chain.sh | sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iex (iwr "https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/uninstall-safe-chain.ps1" -UseBasicParsing)
```

**❗Restart your terminal** after uninstalling to ensure all aliases are removed.

# Configuration

## Logging

You can control the output from Aikido Safe Chain using the `--safe-chain-logging` flag or the `SAFE_CHAIN_LOGGING` environment variable.

### Configuration Options

You can set the logging level through multiple sources (in order of priority):

1. **CLI Argument** (highest priority):
   - `--safe-chain-logging=silent` - Suppresses all Aikido Safe Chain output except when malware is blocked. The package manager output is written to stdout as normal, and Safe Chain only writes a short message if it has blocked malware and causes the process to exit.

     ```shell
     npm install express --safe-chain-logging=silent
     ```

   - `--safe-chain-logging=verbose` - Enables detailed diagnostic output from Aikido Safe Chain. Useful for troubleshooting issues or understanding what Safe Chain is doing behind the scenes.

     ```shell
     npm install express --safe-chain-logging=verbose
     ```

2. **Environment Variable**:

   ```shell
   export SAFE_CHAIN_LOGGING=verbose
   npm install express
   ```

   Valid values: `silent`, `normal`, `verbose`

   This is useful for setting a default logging level for all package manager commands in your terminal session or CI/CD environment.

## File Logging

You can mirror Aikido Safe Chain output to a log file using the `--safe-chain-log-file` flag or the `SAFE_CHAIN_LOG_FILE` environment variable. File logging is disabled by default and enabled when a path is set. The file format (`--safe-chain-log-file-format`) and verbosity (`--safe-chain-log-file-verbosity`) are controlled independently from the terminal output.

### Configuration Options

Set through any of these (in order of priority):

1. **CLI Argument** (highest priority):

   ```shell
   npm install express \
     --safe-chain-log-file=~/safe-chain.log \
     --safe-chain-log-file-format=plain \
     --safe-chain-log-file-verbosity=normal
   ```

2. **Environment Variable**:

   ```shell
   export SAFE_CHAIN_LOG_FILE=~/safe-chain.log
   export SAFE_CHAIN_LOG_FILE_FORMAT=plain
   export SAFE_CHAIN_LOG_FILE_VERBOSITY=normal
   ```

3. **Config File** (`~/.safe-chain/config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "logFile": "~/safe-chain.log",
     "logFileFormat": "plain",
     "logFileVerbosity": "normal"
   }
   ```

`logFileFormat` — `json` (default) or `plain`.

`logFileVerbosity` — `silent`, `normal`, or `verbose` (default). Independent from `--safe-chain-logging`.

## Minimum Package Age

You can configure how long packages must exist before Safe Chain allows their installation. By default, packages must be at least 48 hours old before they can be installed.

For npm-based package managers, this check currently has two enforcement modes:

- Safe Chain suppresses too-young versions from package metadata during normal dependency resolution.
- Safe Chain blocks direct package download requests when they are matched against the cached newly released packages list.

For Python package managers, this check currently has two enforcement modes:

- Safe Chain suppresses too-young files and releases from PyPI metadata during dependency resolution.
- Safe Chain blocks direct package download requests when they are matched against the cached newly released packages list.

### Configuration Options

You can set the minimum package age through multiple sources (in order of priority):

1. **CLI Argument** (highest priority):

   ```shell
   npm install express --safe-chain-minimum-package-age-hours=48
   ```

2. **Environment Variable**:

   ```shell
   export SAFE_CHAIN_MINIMUM_PACKAGE_AGE_HOURS=48
   npm install express
   ```

3. **Config File** (`~/.safe-chain/config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "minimumPackageAgeHours": 48
   }
   ```

### Excluding Packages

Exclude trusted packages from minimum age filtering via environment variable or config file (both are merged). Use `@scope/*` to trust all packages from an organization:

```shell
export SAFE_CHAIN_MINIMUM_PACKAGE_AGE_EXCLUSIONS="@aikidosec/*"
```

```json
{
  "npm": {
    "minimumPackageAgeExclusions": ["@aikidosec/*"]
  },
  "pip": {
    "minimumPackageAgeExclusions": ["requests"]
  }
}
```

## Custom Registries

Configure Safe Chain to scan packages from custom or private registries.

Supported ecosystems:

- Node.js
- Python

### Configuration Options

You can set custom registries through environment variable or config file. Both sources are merged together.

1. **Environment Variable** (comma-separated):

   ```shell
   export SAFE_CHAIN_NPM_CUSTOM_REGISTRIES="npm.company.com,registry.internal.net"
   export SAFE_CHAIN_PIP_CUSTOM_REGISTRIES="pip.company.com,registry.internal.net"
   ```

2. **Config File** (`~/.safe-chain/config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "npm": {
       "customRegistries": ["npm.company.com", "registry.internal.net"]
     },
     "pip": {
       "customRegistries": ["pip.company.com", "registry.internal.net"]
     }
   }
   ```

## PYPI Configuration File

If you rely on a `pip.conf` file for pip configuration you must point pip at it explicitly via the `PIP_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable so Safe Chain can merge it.

Safe Chain runs pip behind its MITM proxy and writes a temporary pip configuration file to inject its certificate and proxy settings. When `PIP_CONFIG_FILE` is set, Safe Chain merges its settings into a copy of your file (your original file is never modified) so your `index-url`, credentials, and other options are preserved. When `PIP_CONFIG_FILE` is not set, pip's user-level config (e.g. `~/.config/pip/pip.conf`) might be overridden by Safe Chain's temporary file and your settings will not be picked up.

## Malware List Base URL

Configure Safe Chain to fetch malware databases and new packages lists from a custom mirror URL. This allows you to host your own copy of the Aikido malware database.

### Configuration Options

You can set the malware list base URL through multiple sources (in order of priority):

1. **CLI Argument** (highest priority):

   ```shell
   npm install express --safe-chain-malware-list-base-url=https://your-mirror.com
   ```

2. **Environment Variable**:

   ```shell
   export SAFE_CHAIN_MALWARE_LIST_BASE_URL=https://your-mirror.com
   npm install express
   ```

3. **Config File** (`~/.safe-chain/config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "malwareListBaseUrl": "https://your-mirror.com"
   }
   ```

The base URL should point to a server that mirrors the structure of `https://malware-list.aikido.dev/`, including the following paths:
- `/malware_predictions.json` (JavaScript ecosystem malware database)
- `/malware_pypi.json` (Python ecosystem malware database)
- `/releases/npm.json` (JavaScript new packages list)
- `/releases/pypi.json` (Python new packages list)

## Project Config File

In addition to the home-directory config file (`~/.safe-chain/config.json`), Safe Chain supports a project config file so that settings can be checked into a repository and shared across a team, instead of being configured per-machine.

Add a `safe-chain:` section to the `.aikido` file at the root of your repository (the same file used by other Aikido tools, Safe Chain only reads its own `safe-chain:` section and ignores the rest). When found, its settings are merged on top of your home-directory config file: values set in the project config take priority, and arrays (such as `customRegistries`) are combined from both files rather than one replacing the other.

Only the following settings can be set from a project config file:

```yaml
safe-chain:
  minimumPackageAgeHours: 48
  npm:
    customRegistries:
      - npm.company.com
    minimumPackageAgeExclusions:
      - "@aikidosec/*"
  pip:
    customRegistries:
      - pip.company.com
    minimumPackageAgeExclusions:
      - requests
```

Settings like `scanTimeout`, `malwareListBaseUrl`, and the `logFile*` options cannot be set from a project config file - they can only come from your home-directory config, CLI arguments, or environment variables.

## Custom Install Directory

By default, Safe Chain installs itself into `~/.safe-chain`. You can change this by passing an explicit install directory to the installer. This is useful for system-wide installations (e.g. inside a Docker image) or when you need to avoid conflicts with other tools.

When set, all Safe Chain data (binary, shims, scripts, config) is placed under the custom directory instead of `~/.safe-chain`.

### Unix/Linux/macOS

```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.sh -o /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh \
  && echo "7a7b6e54c2e0adbcb53bc1bf7d258cc974f8f31e77ed048b88e4d2e4ac758839  /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh" | sha256sum -c - \
  && sh /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh --install-dir /usr/local/.safe-chain \
  && rm /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh
```

### Windows

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "install-safe-chain.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.ps1" -OutFile $installer -UseBasicParsing

```

# Usage in CI/CD

You can protect your CI/CD pipelines from malicious packages by integrating Aikido Safe Chain into your build process. This ensures that any packages installed during your automated builds are checked for malware before installation.

## Installation for CI/CD

Use the `--ci` flag to automatically configure Aikido Safe Chain for CI/CD environments. This sets up executable shims in the PATH instead of shell aliases.

### Unix/Linux/macOS (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, etc.)

```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.sh -o /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh \

## Jenkins Example

Note: This assumes Node.js and npm are installed on the Jenkins agent.

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    // Jenkins does not automatically persist PATH updates from setup-ci,
    // so add the shims + binary directory explicitly for all stages.
    // If you installed into a custom directory, replace ~/.safe-chain with that path here.
    PATH = "${env.HOME}/.safe-chain/shims:${env.HOME}/.safe-chain/bin:${env.PATH}"
  }

  stages {
    stage('Install safe-chain') {
      steps {
        sh '''
          set -euo pipefail

          # Install Safe Chain for CI
          curl -fsSL https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.sh -o /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh
          echo "7a7b6e54c2e0adbcb53bc1bf7d258cc974f8f31e77ed048b88e4d2e4ac758839  /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh" | sha256sum -c -
          sh /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh --ci
          rm /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh
        '''
      }
    }

    stage('Install project dependencies etc...') {
      steps {
        sh '''
          set -euo pipefail
          npm ci
        '''
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Bitbucket Pipelines Example

```yaml
image: node:22

steps:
  - step:
      name: Install
      script:
        - |
          curl -fsSL https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.sh -o /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh
          echo "7a7b6e54c2e0adbcb53bc1bf7d258cc974f8f31e77ed048b88e4d2e4ac758839  /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh" | sha256sum -c -
          sh /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh --ci
          rm /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh
        - export PATH=~/.safe-chain/shims:~/.safe-chain/bin:$PATH
        - npm ci
```

After setup, all subsequent package manager commands in your CI pipeline will automatically be protected by Aikido Safe Chain's malware detection.

## GitLab Pipelines Example

To add safe-chain in GitLab pipelines, you need to install it in the image running the pipeline. This can be done by:

1. Define a dockerfile to run your build

   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:lts

   # Install safe-chain
   RUN curl -fsSL https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain/releases/download/1.5.16/install-safe-chain.sh -o /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh \
     && echo "7a7b6e54c2e0adbcb53bc1bf7d258cc974f8f31e77ed048b88e4d2e4ac758839  /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh" | sha256sum -c - \
     && sh /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh --ci \
     && rm /tmp/install-safe-chain.sh

   # Add safe-chain to PATH (update paths if you used a custom install dir)
   ENV PATH="/root/.safe-chain/shims:/root/.safe-chain/bin:${PATH}"
   ```

2. Build the Docker image in your CI pipeline

   ```yaml
   build-image:
     stage: build-image
     image: docker:latest
     services:
       - docker:dind
     script:
       - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
       - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest .
       - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
   ```

3. Use the image in your pipeline:
   ```yaml
   npm-ci:
     stage: install
     image: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
     script:
       - npm ci
   ```

The full pipeline for this example looks like this:

```yaml
stages:
  - build-image
  - install

build-image:
  stage: build-image
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker build -t $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest .
    - docker push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest

npm-ci:
  stage: install
  image: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
  script:
    - npm ci
```
